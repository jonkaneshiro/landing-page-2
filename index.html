				<h1>Remote Patient Monitoring System</h1>
				<h4>For patients, providers, physicians and families.</h2>
				<p>Founded by a team of experienced medical device, signal processing, and electrical engineers, LIVMOR has developed a secure, continuous and integrated remote patient monitoring system that allows physicians to enhance their quality of care and ensure patient peace of mind.</p>
				<p>We believe that a person's health is more than just the condition or disease, and is often times a response to an inbalance from multiple stressors.  With this approach, we have engineered our system to view the whole human, as opposed to the disease, in order to provide physicians and caregivers the crucial information needed to make more definitive actions.</p>
				<p>Our remote patient monitoring platform seamlessly integrates and continually transmits cardiorespiratory, weight, blood pressure and and blood glucose information through FDA-approved or clinically-validated devices.  The center of LIVMOR's remote patient monitoring system is our Heart Watch wearable, which has been clinically-validated to continuously measure heart rate and heart rate variability, to accurately quantify and assess stress, recovery, cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2max) and irregular heart rhythms.</p>
				<p>Patient information is securely and wirelessly transmitted, in real-time, to the patient's physician, caregiver and/or family.  Through a higher means of communication and monitoring, physicians are now able to create more personalized care plans, provide continuity of care, reduce healthcare costs, and be there when their patients need them most.</p>

					<p>We are on a mission to further prevent, detect and manage chronic conditions, in real-time and non-invasively.  It is our goal to empower you to live your best life, and we will be with you every beat of the way.</p>
					<p>Our wrist-worn Heart Watch wearable has been clinically validated to continuously measure heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV) to objectively quantify and assess <strong>stress</strong>, <strong>cardio-respiratory fitness</strong> (percentage of max oxygen consumption), <strong>cardiovascular performance</strong> and <strong>irregular heart rhythms</strong>.</p>
					<p>The Heart Watch is integrated into a comprehensive remote patient monitoring system, enabling physicians to monitor their patient's stress, weight, blood pressure and heart rhythms, in real-time and between office visits. Through personalized care plans and a higher means of communication, we provide the necessary tools to enhance quality of care and ensure peace of mind.</p>
